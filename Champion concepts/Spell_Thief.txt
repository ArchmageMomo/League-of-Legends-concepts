Axxid - The spell thief

P:
	Spell scribing:
		
		A study table spawns besides the shop, collecting spells from all teammates and enemies killed by Axxid. Axxid can build or modify his own basic spells by combining components from others when using the study table.
		
		Every spell collected grants access to three Words. Words are separated into major, condition and minor words, major words granting new spell behaviour, condition words adding a status affliction and minor words granting modifications to specific stats. Multiple of the same word can be added to a spell. Slots for major and condition words can instead be filled with minor words.
		
		Examples of Major Words:
		
			Multiplicity (Gained through Orb of Deception, Blooming Burst): The effect of the ability gets played in reverse once finished
			Targeted (Gained through Fox Fire, Icathian Rain): The Ability automatically targets the closest enemy (champion) within range
			Physics (Gained through the more boring AD abilities): Changes the damage type to physical
			
		Examples of Condition Words:
			
			Charm: The ability charms enemies on hit
			Fear: The ability fears enemies on hit
			
		Examples of Minor Words:
			
			Damage: Increases damage
			Speed: Increases the speed of the ability
			Cooldown: Reduce the cooldown of the ability
			Range: Increases the range of the ability
			
		With equiping a word from a spell, the new spell gains particle effects resembling the spell

		On levels 3, 9 and 15 one additional minor word can be equiped to the basic attacks slot. Basic attacks deal magic damage (unless changed by a word).
