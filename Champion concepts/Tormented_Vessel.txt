As the Rune Wars raged, Mount Targon stood as a beacon against the oncoming darkness. During that time Mihira and Kilam began the perilous climb in search of the power to save their tribe from destruction.
Even when Mihira learned she was with child, she pushed onward. At the mountain’s summit, she was chosen as a divine vessel for the Aspect of Justice, wielding a sword that blazed with a fire brighter than the sun.
Not long after, the twins were born. Kayle, the elder by a breath, was as bright as Morgana was dark.
But Mihira had become a fearsome warrior, far greater than any mortal. Kilam began to fear her new divinity, and the sorcerous enemies that were drawn to her light. He resolved to take the girls out of harm’s way, journeying across the Conqueror's Sea to a settlement where the land itself was said to offer protection against magic.
When Mihira returned home she believed that her enemies had captured her family. Eventually the war ended, but none of her angry fights had revealed the fate of her family. She desperately followed every trace she had left, but none of them lead her to Kilam, Kayle and Morgana.
Years passed, Mihira gave up hope and instead reduced her life to an eternal hunt for wrongdoers. When she finally found her daughters she was stunned at first as she didn't even look for them that day, but they were unmistakenly her daughters, one as bright as the other was dark. That's when realization hit her. Kilam took them and fled to keep them safe while she was fighting a war in the name of justice and exposed them to danger every day anew. She was transformed into a tool of death, exterminating anyone either she or the aspect found full of guilt. What would happen if she found guilt inside her daughters? Mihira decided that they were better off without her, but before she flew off she also decided to gift them her her sword, just to let them know she was alive and cared.
When Mihira heared the stories about Kayle and Morgana's fight she immedeately returned to the village, just to find Kilam dead and her daughters nowhere to be found. The more she found out about what happened the guiltier she felt. It seemed that Kayle had decided to follow her example and Mihira finally realized what her strive for justice had actually made of her.
Ever since Mihira hid in the most secret corners of Runeterra, ignoring the Aspects call for justice. Somehow she knew that Kayle and Morgana would meet each other in fight eventually, and she swore herself that she wouldn't just stand aside when the time had come.





Interactions:
	Kayle:
		"Kayle... I've failed you."
		"Your way of bringing justice is even more cruel than mine ever was."
		"Set off to cleanse the world? You must be stopped."
		"Is there any regret behind that armor you wear?"
		
	Morgana:
		"Morgana... I am so sorry..."
		"Go figure, one kills, one rehabilitates."
		"You were able to do what neither your sister nor I could."
		"Why did you chain down your beautiful wings?"
