The Spirit of New Life:

Basic:
	200 Units Melee

P:
	The call of Life:
		<Name> spawns with (5-15) animal soldiers at his side. Animal soldiers follow him and attack enemies using their spears, dealing (5-20)+20%AD physical damage per hit each. They can hit enemies in a 200 units radius of them, have 15% max HP each and the champions armor and MR.
		
		Once every minute a group of up to (3-10) animal soldiers spawns at fountain and join <Name>. Up to 35 animal soldiers can be active at once. Returning to base restocks the soldiers.
		
		When <Name> dies, all remaining soldiers fight on their own and return to base if they have no enemy in vision range.
		Soldiers generate vision.
	
Q:
	Formation change ( - / (7/6.5/6/5.5/5) s / 10 Mana)
		The animal soldiers change their fighting style:
		
		Melee Triangular: Soldiers build a triangle around <Name> and attack anything that is in their range. Their damage gets increased by (5/7/9/11/13/15) + 5% AD.
		Ranged Line: Soldiers build a line in front of <Name> and have (300/350/400/450/500) Units ranged attacks. <Name> can direct their attacks (ref Azir).
		Defensive Circle: Soldiers stand in a circle around <Name?>, block any incoming ranged attack and act as a one-way wall to enemies. They can't attack, but gain a shield worth (80/110/140/170/200)% of their max health that regenerates within 5 seconds after taking damage.
		
W:
	Taking camp (global / 3 max (60/50/40/30/20) s / 50 Mana)
		One animal soldier gets sent to the targeted location to prepare a camp. Once he arrives he takes (5/4/3/2/1) seconds to finish and serves as the first soldier at the camp. Enemies standing on empty camps for 2 seconds destroy them and gain 5 Gold. Camps block vision on them for everyone more than 550 Units away.
		
		Once every (60/50/40/35/30) seconds one soldier per camp active spawns at fountain for up to 3 soldiers per camp.
		Soldiers at camps attack every enemy or neutral target within 500 Units with ranged attacks, dealing (20/30/40/50/60) + 40% AD physical damage.
		
E:
	Aim and fire (500 Units [soldiers global] / (8/7/6/5/4) s / 50 Mana)
		The soldiers and <Name> shoot a rain of arrows each at the targeted 200 Units radius location. Every enemy inside gets damaged by (10/20/30/40/50) + 10% AD physical damage + 92% of the previous rain of arrows damage up to a maximum of sum([(10/20/30/40/50) + 10% AD] * 11.88 physical damage.
		
R:
	For Honor and Newborn ((1700/2500/3000) Units / - / - )
		The soldiers that would normaly follow <Name> can be controlled now.
		Casting the ability on any target in range makes the soldiers attack this target.
		Casting the ability on any spot in range will make the soldiers go to that location.
		Casting the ability on an ally makes the soldiers follow that ally.
