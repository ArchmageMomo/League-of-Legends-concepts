There was once an ionian legend about a swan god, walking among mortals.
Many have told storys of a black swan, with sparkling feathers. Everyone of them tried to catch and sell it for a good price, but nobody even came near it. It seemed that their feet got heavier with every step they approached it. Other ones told storys about a devil in a swans skin, killing everyone who try to attack it. Many swear to see its guardians near lakes and ponds, but nobody ever had a proof except some extremely heavy Feathers.
Storys are still just storys, but one thing is for sure. The black swan exists, sometimes showing its face to mere humans in order to remind them of its presence.
