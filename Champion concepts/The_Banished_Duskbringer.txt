The Banished Duskbringer


B:
	500 Ranged (quickly fly after a small delay after the the animation)
	
P:
	Ascended by Starfire:
		Every time Semaraa has dealt 3000 + 500 * ascension stage (except the free one on E) damage to enemy champions or legendary monsters her ascension stage gets increased by 1.
		
		Per stage her AD, AP and HP get increased by 3% and her range gets increased by 20 units up to a maximum of 200 units bonus range.
		At the second ascension stage starfire burst out of her wings and leave behind a trail. Every enemy and neutral target touching the trail takes (5-90) + 10% AP + 10 * ascension stage magic damage per half second. Her MS gets increased by 2%.

Q:
	Dark barrage (1100 Units / (10/9/8/7/6) s / (40/50/60/70/80) Mana)
		After channeling for 1 second Semaraa fires 5 projectiles of dark matter dealing (8/16/24/32/40) + (20/25/30/35/40) % AD + (22/24/26/28/30) % AP adaptive damage each. The first one is larger than the others and pulls every enemy it touches to its current center. The first projectile pierces all enemies, the smaller ones are blocked by enemy champions and reduce the cooldown of this ability by 0.5 seconds per small orb if they deal magic damage.
		Minions take 40% damage.
	
W:
	Godsoul scorch (1000 Units / 12 s / (70/85/100/115/130) Mana)
		Semaraa throws a blob of dark matter. If it hits an enemy champion or epic or legendary monster it deals (70/80/90/100/110) + 100 % AD physical damage and sticks to it, else it just stays where it hit the ground. For the next 5 seconds the orb summons a steady stream of spikes in a 200 units radius out of the ground, dealing (5/10/15/20/25) + 14% AD physical damage per half second and slows for (1.5% per 50 AP). 
	
E:
	Ripping Sho'ma (600 Units / (20/18/16/14/12) s / (35/40/45/50/55) Mana)
		The targeted enemy or legendary monster gets marked for 4 seconds. Every time an individual spell or attack from Semaraa hits the enemy it gets damaged by additional (10/20/30/40/50) + 50 % AP magic damage, resets the marks duration and rips one part of Sho'ma.
		
		After 5 hits, the mark disappears and Semaraa gets healed by (10/15/20/25/30)% of the damage dealt.
		Once 25 parts of Sho'ma got ripped from a champion Semaraa instead gains (10/20/30/40/50) % damage mirror towards the marked enemy champion for 4 seconds, meaning the percentage of the damage received from that enemy gets inflicted to this enemy instead. (Excludes True damage)
		If all enemy champions got 25 parts of Sho'ma ripped from them Semaraa gains one free ascension stage. (doesn't affect passive damage requirements)
	
R:
	Dusk Star (global / 120 s / 100 Mana)
		Semaraa channels for 2 seconds to summon a star of twilight with a radius of 250 + 62.5 per 100 AP Units up to a maximum of + 500 Units. The star travels with a speed of 60 % MS (excluding homeguard and buffs from champions) and deals (350/400/450) + 200% AD + 145% AP adaptive damage to epic monsters and the first enemy champion hit, 20% of the damage to minions and non-legendary monsters and 40% damage to every enemy champion after the first one.
		
		The star disappears if it travels behind the enemy nexus.
		As long as an allied or enemy champion is near or inside the star it gets translucent.









Long before the first Shuriman ascended through the sundisc, the aspects of Targon experimented with other forms of ascension. One of the few successful experiments ended up creating a being the aspects were barely able to control with their combined efforts. In fear of it they bound it to the moon and kept it contained.
The being, a Vastayashai'rei that got exposed to the energy of a cosmic dragon, was called Semaraa. She envied the Shuriman empire when it rose with the help of the Ascended, and laughed as ascension became their downfall, she watched the cataclysms and cursed at the aspects for standing aside, and she cried as her former homelands disappeared behind a black unnatural mist.
When Semaraa finally broke her shackles she swore to protect runeterra from whatever might endanger it and its inhabitants.

When you wish upon a star

A flash of light drew Kanehas attention while he sunk his sable teeth into a grilled fish. A shooting star traveled across the sky, followed by another one. He wasn't superstitious, but never the less he closed his eyes and thought of something he desired. As he opened his eyes again he looked into the sky again just to be stunned by another bigger shooting star lighting the night-sky. It took a while for Kanehas to realize that something was off. It didn't travel across the sky as the other ones did and instead just got bigger while it fell from the sky. Unable to move he watched it drawing closer until it disappeared behind the tips of the forest. The cracking of wood told him that the shooting star must have landed near his camp. He noticed that his mouth stood wide open and closed it before he ran into the direction he last saw the shooting star.

Semaraa leaned at a tree and tried not to scream. It took some time until the pain of entering runeterras atmosphere decreased to a manageable amount, and still she felt like she went through literal hellfire. The more she thought about it, the less farfetched this comparison sounded to her. After all she did burn at reentry. When she felt ready she took a look at her surroundings. She appeared to have landed in a forest. There were some small flames where she came in contact with the trees, but that was nothing that would lead to any major damage. Her clothes did burn off though. She stretched her wings before she folded them completely and looked at the sky. The moon looked so tiny, and yet seemed to taunt her even after she escaped. She forced herself to look away and started walking into a random direction.

It wasn't long until she felt someone nearby. Curiously she sneaked up to them and hid behind a tree so that she could see them. The Sho'ma of one of them told Semaraa that he was a mostly harmless being, probably a Vastayashai'rei. The other one confused her as it felt like the Sho'ma of three persons combined, but she didn't have to read its Sho'ma to understand its agressive behaviour. It held a bow in its hand and had a red glowing arrow pointed at the Vastayashai'rei. But something was off. The person with the bow seemed to struggle to release the arrow. Semaraa took a deep breath and released a small portion of her power to form a star in her hand. Both the Vastayashai'rei and the person with the bow turned towards her in shock.
"Don't care what is going on. Run or die." Semaraa felt awkward using her voice after all this time and noticed that the sentences were off in some way. But it was appearent that both of them understood her. Just for show she spread her wings and took a step closer. "What will it be?"
"That's not possible!" said the one with the bow with a shaky voice. His confusing Sho'ma told her that he was something between scared to the bone and pleasantly surprised. Semaraa took another step forward. Now the one with the confusing Sho'ma paniced and released the arrow, but he missed.
"That your choice?" she asked in the most unimpressed voice she could and took another step forward. She would have no problem killing the strange man with the bow, but she would much more prefer to simply scare him off. And indeed he took a step back. "Last chance. Run now or die a fool." The man backed off a bit more. She took another step forward, and that was what finally made him run. When Semaraa was sure that he was gone she banished the star and its warmth in an instant.
"Thank you for saving me." The Vastayashai'rei said. His name was Kaneha and he went away from his camp to look where a shooting star had landed. And he called himself a Vastaya.
"What are Vastaya?" she bluntly asked, interrupting whatever Kaneha wanted to say. He took a breath, but then took a confused look at her.
"Shouldn't you know that yours..."
"No. Except Vastaya and Vastayashai'rei are the same which I doubt as you insist on vocal conversation." She could literally see his jaw drop. "You have a camp nearby? Let's go there while we talk."

When they got to the camp the fire Kaneha had prepared had already burned down. He has told Semaraa everything he could remember from the stories he was told as a child, but most of them depicted the Vastayashai'rei way different than they really were.
"So there are no known Vastayashai'rei alive." she concluded and placed some branches in the fire pit.
"Not to my knowledge. Except you, appearantly." She laughed shortly and ignited the branches with a tiny bit of her powers. With a look at the Vastaya whose jaw had dropped again and who held flint and steel in his hands she had to laugh again.
"You thought that this was just for show? He could as well be less than a pile of ash by now." She pointed at a bag. "Have any spare clothing you could give me?" He snapped out of it and started searching in the bag.
"Were all Vastayashai'rei able to do that?" he asked while he pulled out some pants.
"No. But I could show you something all of us were able to do."
"It would be an honor." Almost instantly Semaraa made her body copy the shape of Kanehas.
"We were defined more through our Sho'ma than we were through our bodies." She said in his voice "In theory everyone of us was able to mimic the shape of anything as long as it had Sho'ma."
"You mean a soul?" he asked.
"That's not exactly what Sho'ma is." She thought about it for a second. "But to simplify things, yes. Also we rarely used our voice as it is much easier to read the Sho'ma of the others as long as they could read yours. There were no secrets."
"But you can speak quite well. Where did you learn to?" Kaneha handed the pants and a travelers-cloak to her, which she put on top of a stone.
"A friend of mine tought me before we went on a journey to her village." She changed her shape again, this time to a bat, took off and flew a few circles before landing and turning into her favourite shape again. It wasn't just for show, but also for her to move around a bit. "You don't happen to have anything to cover my chest, don't you?" 
"If you are ok with dusty bandages?"
"Will suffice." *At least if it isn't any more moondust.* She put on the pants and started to wrap her chest into the bandages. When she considered herself covered she turned towards Kaneha again. "Can I keep it?"
"Of course. I don't really need that old stuff anyway, and the bandages were just rotting in the bag for years now." Semaraa nodded and put on the cloak. It felt good to wear relatively new clothes again. She sat down on a rock when she felt the confusing Sho'ma again.
"Seek cover. He's back." she hissed and jumped to her feet. She knew where the red arrow was coming from before she saw it and catched it out of the air before it reached her. "You are either brave or stupid." Semaraa burned the arrow in her hand releasing a foul smell. Another arrow hit the tree behind her as she jumped into the air and summoned her own projectiles against the man with the bow. She could see him hiding behind a tree as the spheres of something-really-dark flew past him. She hovered above the fire and summoned another barrage of super-dark-stuff in her hands. The next arrow flew, but it wasn't aimed at her. Kanehas body dropped to the ground as his Sho'ma diffused back into the worlds endless cycle. Semaraa screamed in rage. She had known the Vastaya for just a short time, but he had grown close to her in some way. She ignited a super-dark-star between her hands and released it at the man with the bow. The world seemed to ignite until Semaraa banished the dark star and returned night to the world most of the forest in front of her had disappeared and got replaced by literal scorched earth and the surrounding trees catched fire. There was also no trace of the strange man left. Semaraa sighed and floated back to the floor. *What a crapy day.* she thought and went to work through the dead Vastayas bag. He didn't have much useful stuff with him, but at least he had some bread. She could use something to eat after all this time. But for now she left the bread alone and turned her attention towards the corpse. *I probably should get rid of him too.* In lack of any better idea she summoned another smaller star and lowered it onto the body. When she was finished she ate the bread and went to sleep on the mossy floor.
