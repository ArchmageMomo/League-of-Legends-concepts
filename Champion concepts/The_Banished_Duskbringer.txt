The Banished Duskbringer


B:
	500 Ranged
	
P:
	Ascended by Starfire:
		Every time Semaraa has dealt 3000 + 500 * ascension stage (except the free one on E) damage to enemy champions or legendary monsters her ascension stage gets increased by 1.
		
		Per stage her AD, AP and HP get increased by 1% and her range gets increased by 20 up to a maximum of 200.
		At the second ascension stage wings of starfire burst out of her wings and leave behind a trail. Every enemy and neutral target touching the wings or trail takes (5-90) + 5% AP + 5 * ascension stage magic damage per half second. Her her MS gets increased by 2%.

Q:
	Dark barrage (1100 Units / (10/9/8/7/6) s / (40/50/60/70/80) Mana)
		After channeling for 1 second Semaraa fires 5 projectiles of dark matter dealing (8/16/24/32/40) + (20/25/30/35/40) % AD + (22/24/26/28/30) % AP adaptive damage each. The first one is larger than the others and pulls every enemy it touches to its center. The first projectile pierces all enemies, the smaller ones are blocked by enemy champions if they deal magic damage.
		Minions take 40% damage.
	
W:
	Godsoul scorch (1000 Units / 12 s / (70/85/100/115/130) Mana)
		Semaraa throws a blob of dark matter. If it hits an enemy champion or epic or legendary monster it deals (70/80/90/100/110) + 100 % AD physical damage and sticks to it, else it just stays where it hit the ground. For the next 5 seconds the orb summons a steady stream of spikes in a 200 units radius out of the ground, dealing (5/10/15/20/25) + 14% AD physical damage per half second.
	
E:
	Ripping Sho'ma (600 Units / (20/18/16/14/12) s / (35/40/45/50/55) Mana)
		The targeted enemy or legendary monster gets marked for (8/8.5/9/9.5/10) seconds. Every time an individual spell or attack from Semaraa hits the enemy it gets damaged by additional (10/20/30/40/50) + 30 % AP magic damage and rips one part of Sho'ma.
		
		After 5 hits, the mark disappears and Semaraa gets healed by (10/15/20/25/30)% of the damage dealt.
		Once 25 parts of Sho'ma got ripped from a champion Semaraa gains (10/20/30/40/50) % damage mirror towards the marked enemy champion for 4 seconds, meaning 50% of the damage received from that enemy gets inflicted to this enemy instead. (Excludes True damage and DoT effects)
		If all enemy champions got 25 parts of Sho'ma ripped from them Semaraa gains one free ascension stage.
	
R:
	Dusk Star (global / 90 s / 100 Mana)
		Semaraa channels for 2 seconds to summon a star of twilight with a radius of 250 + 62.5 per 100 AP Units up to a maximum of + 500 Units. The star travels with a speed of (60/70/80) % MS and deals (350/400/450) + 140% AD + 80% AP adaptive damage to epic monsters and the first enemy champion hit, 40% of the damage to minions and non-legendary monsters and 50% damage to every enemy champion after the first one.
		
		The star disappears if it travels behind the enemy nexus.









Long before the first Shuriman ascended through the sundisc, the aspects of Targon experimented with other forms of ascension. One of the few successful experiments ended up creating a being the aspects were barely able to controll with their combined efforts. In fear of it they bound it to the moon and kept it contained.
The being, a Vastayashai'rei that got exposed to the energy of a cosmic dragon, was called Semaraa. She envied the Shuriman empire when it rose with the help of the Ascended, and laughed as ascension became their downfall, she watched the cataclysms and cursed at the aspects for standing aside, and she cried as her former homelands died to the grief of a ruined king.
When Semaraa finally broke her shackles she swore to protect runeterra from whatever might endanger it and its inhabitants.
