The Lily Ghost


B:
	600 Units
	
P:
	Lifeless Nectar:
		Every third basic attack and every ability cast creates a blob of nectar somewhere in a 500 Units radius of Lily for 5 seconds. Nectar grounds and slows enemies by (10-50)%.
		
Q:
	Rootwhip (800 Units / (10/9/8/7/6) s / 50 Mana)
		Lily flings out a whip dealing (70/110/150/190/230) + 50% AP magic damage and disarming the first enemy hit for 0.5 seconds. If the whip hits close to max range the damage is doubled.
		
W:
	Undead blossom (1000 Units/ (60/50/40/30/20) per charge; 2 charges / 70 Mana)
		Lily throws a seed at the targeted location. After a brief delay a pile of leaves covers it and the trap is active while going invisible. The trap can be destroyed by basic attacking it 3 times or after (60-180) seconds based on level.
		
		Enemies stepping on the trap will get fixated inside a blossom and stabed by spiky vines for (70/100/130/150/180) + 35% AP magic damage after 0.5 and 1 seconds before being released again after 1.2 seconds.
		Activated traps act as walls.
		Activating traps interrupts dashes.
		3 traps can be active at once.
		
		FIXATED: Immobilizes, but can be broken using any mobility spell
		
E:
	Glimmer of hope ( - / (35/30/25/20/15) s / 80 Mana)
		A single healthy lily blossom appears at Lilys location and blocks up to (50/80/110/140/170) + 35% AP damage from any source but towers for any allied champion or structure hit inside a 300 Units radius.
		
		When no shieldable target is in range the lily can be attacked directly
		
R:
	Widespread roots ( 1000 Units to global / 120 s / (150/125/100) Mana) Passive
		A greater lily appears at the base. Any ally can activate it and fasttravel towards Lilys current location on cost of her Mana once per time intervall (cooldown).
		Enemies can fasttravel towards her corpse if she is dead, but take 20% longer to get there.
		
		
		
Before the blessed isles fell Lily was a spirit taking care of the flora. As everything around her changed, she kept her airheaded and bright personality while adapting to her changed environment. Outsiders living long enough to take a glimps at her see her as a spark of light in a sea of shadows, only to find out that they ran straight into her trap.
But like everyone else, she too had a secret, as her secret garden wasn't made to follow the rules of the shadow isles.
