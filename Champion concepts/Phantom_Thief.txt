Pherro was once just a thief in the city of Zaun. At his biggest job yet, he got caught by some so called scientists and became their test subject. Unfortunatly for everyone related, the experement was a failure and the factory exploded. He survived with bad injuries and was at the edge to death when he reached his home, where he lost conciousnes. When he reawoke, his pain was gone. Looking at his body, he didn't see any of his injuries left. He lived as before, until that job, where he had to steal the device of kid with white hair and black skin. This kid never left his device, so Pherro knew he only had one way to steal it. That was the moment, where he found about what the experement did to him. The kid somehow he would attack him and attacked him instead, but all he hit was some black mist, that spreaded all over the kids place. Pherro didn't know what happened, but he left the place, knowing he would never be the same as before, and he would never be able to kill this kid. He quit the job, what enraged the scientist, causing him to attack Pherro. His body was found later the same day, covered by some black mist.
Since then, he used his abilities to manipulate the mist his body produces to take things from the rich and give them to the poor. Soon he was loved and feared as the phantom thief, and everyone knew that seeing the black mist would either cost them their precous things or lifes or give them new hope, as he sololy tries to cleanse Zaun from corruption.
