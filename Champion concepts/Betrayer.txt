Genesé was a loyal and playful fairy of the fae-kingdom. One day her friend Pix returned with a curious yordle girl and continued to spend all of his time playing with her instead. All of Genesés attempts to remind him of his other friends and his duties failed and even the fairy-king was clueless as she turned to him for help. That was when her loyalty crumbled and she got angrier at everyone every day. When Pix and the girl disappeared Genesé tried to follow them, but was stopped by the king. She left anyway, with the remains of the kingdom smoldering behind her. Now she looks for her friend, unsure whether to talk sense into him or leave his remains to rot.
