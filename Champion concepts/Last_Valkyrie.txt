The Raven knows all things that were and will come. Everyone in the hall of heros knew that he built it to prepare for the fight against a greater evil even he was scared of. When Hruja was recruited as one of his Valkyries she was determined to save Runeterra using all her essence if she had to. But one day the Raven disappeared, and soon after the void attacked the hall.
As the attack was over Hruja was one of the last survivors. She collected her runestones which she spread during the battle. With each stone she picked up she grew more confident in what she had to do. The last stone she picked up was different than the others. It had no rune carved into it, but radiated a power greater and scarier than of any other of the stones. It was the runestone the raven took out of the valkyries runebags, the rune of void.
Ever since she collected the souls of fallen heros to restock the hall in preparation of the final battle against the void.
