Yútre became a Valkyrie a long time ago. In the name of her God, she collected Souls of fallen heroes to build an army for the last fight. As one of few Valkyries she learned about the runes of the gods. Fascinated about their abilities, she begged her god to teach her their magic. He agreed, making her one of the strongest Valkyries of the swarm. She continued collecting souls as she improved her abilities even further, to survive the end of all days.
That was, until she had a vision caused by the rune Ansuz. She saw herself at the surface without her armor, kissing a human she could not clearly see. That night she knew, she would never be happy again in her eternal life if she continues living without love, so she broke her oath never to seek love, taking her runestones, sword and armor with her to the surface of Runeterra.
Even though she became a fallen valkyrie, Yútre's abilities as a valkyrie weren't taken from her, so she continued collecting heroic souls. She knows that her god knows what she did, but she doesn't know if he still protects her. Sometimes she wishes to never have abandoned her life as a valkyrie of the swarm, but then she reminds herself of the vision she had and works even harder to find who she's looking for.

"A life without love isn't woth living. Neither for a mere human, nor for an eternal Valkyrie." - Yútre
