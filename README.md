# Introduction
My pseudonym is Archmage Momo and I play League of Legends on EUW since December 2015. Just like many others I soon had my own totally awsome and definitely not broken Ideas for new champions.
That said I unfortunately lack the artistic skills to make visual concepts like many other creators, so instead I started working on textual concepts and focused on describing the abilities and character of the champions I envisioned. Even though these early concepts were far from realistic I had a great time thinking of ever new concepts. Some of them landed on my tumblr blog (it still exists, but i have no plans for it atm), but most never made it off my harddrive.
Until i created this repo that is.

# First of all, I am no Rioter
Never expect any of these concepts to be in game. I create these just to relax and imagine what could be. I have no actual clue on how design processes at riot really work and probably never will.
If you are a Rioter and like my ideas I'd appreciate any feedback you are willing and allowed to give. That's the way to improve, ain't it?

# I write a lot, but I have different projects as well
Is there any more to say? It might happen that I won't add any concept to this repo for a long time as I have other things that I want to work on. Also my creativity has its limits and I might have no actual inspiration for anything amazing.

# Balance is irrelevant ...
... as long as these concepts don't become reality. I might have created concepts that lack any sign of balancing or were just created in another meta. Some concepts I tried to balance, but without propper gameplay tests this is an impossible task to achieve. I base all my balance calculations on ever changing extremes and real references.

# About Lore conformity
Some of the concepts have story snippets attached to the gameplay concept. To be fair, I haven't really known what was canon until the universe page went live and that resulted in some chaotic stories.
However, nowadays I try to stay as lore conform as possible. I sometimes mix in some things that riot would (most likely) never do, but I do the best I can on my research.

# Let's talk grammar and spelling
I am no native (for those who want to know I'm Austrian) and I didn't care about propper english in the begining. However I started caring at one point, so go ahead and help me improve new concepts.

# You are an artist and want to ...
### ... help?
I appreciate any help of actual artists. Contact me on social media so we can work out the details.
### ... brutally claim my work as yours because you had most of the work with the artworks?
Simply don't.
### ... post some fan art?
Reference me please. I will try to honor your work as long as it is appropriate and I notice it.
