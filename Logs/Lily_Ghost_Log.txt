I'm gonna break with the "super duper nice and bright" spirit concept and make her a real ghost. But a funny one that is.
She will be the most aniconic shadow isles character at least I can imagine.

I guess nectar is a nice idea for a nature spirit, just not the way I used it in the last iteration. That was simply unintuitive and stupid in gameplay. Also it wouldn't fit her theme at all. Let's turn it into a CC ability. Random splatters of nectar that slow and ground enemies every time you cast an ability and every third basic attack?

While writing i had to think of another name. I call her Lily. Creative, isn't it?

Q feels like it could be a low value poke ability. How about some healthy whipping? A micro disarm to give it at least some real value? And some additional damage in the tip?

For the W I think a trap would work out fine. I want it to hold enemies in place, but give them the option to use a mobility spell to escape. It should also deal some damage after a brief delay. So, what would fit the theme of a nature spirit? A death-blossom :P

I want a shield in her kit as well. A stationary bubble that shields any ally inside. I guess if nobody is inside the source itself can be attacked to be popped.

Her old Ult is like a more conditional version of TP. Let's make it even more conditional and only indirectly usefull to her.

I guess I have to give some context to her using a short backstory I won't state my thoughts here, as the actual story will tell more than enough
