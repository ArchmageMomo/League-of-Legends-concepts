First thoughts: FULL REWORK, SCRAP IT!
Second thoughts: Another character with an artist background. Everyone can see his movement but the music or rythm he dances to only exists in his mind. Sounds a lot like Jhin, but not quite as dark.

Let's start with a name. I roll the dice for the region this time as the general idea is pretty generic. I considered the following regions in this order: noxus, zaun, demacia, piltover, shurima, bilgewater
I rolled a 6 on a D6, so Bilgewater it is. Time for a pirate-ish name. Speaking of pirates, how about making "dancing mage" a pirate? With two sabers and magic and stuff. Maybe one of MFs people? Wycombe? Name generators are great

I want to keep him a ranged champion with a dance/rythm focused theme. That said, the old passives were simply overtuned and dumb. Let's make it more simple. Constant basic attacking in a circle. No impact of AS. Once he targets an enemy it turns into a ranged swordbeam.

Rest of the kit is gonna be hard for me.
I want to have an ability that changes the dance style of Wycombe and I would either put it onto his W or his E. After some thinking I decided on Pirate and Prayer style dancing which will influence his other basic abilities.

Pirate Q will be a generic pistol shot. I think of syncing it with his dance pattern.
Prayer Q seems to end up as a generic water spell that deals damage in a circle. Circle range will depend on the time passed inbetween beats.

I just realized that Bilgewater characters have english-ish names. Great. Give me a second to think of a new name. Done. Barry "Wycombe" Sund. I don't have to change a thing.
Ok, the byname Wycombe is stupid in this context. Let's change it to Rythm as it seems to be the most fitting nickname for him. I am amazed by how blind I am at times.

That Q took me way too long. Need a break before working out the details on the remaining basic ability.

I sleeped over the remaining ability. It will be a dash, thus on his E. So let's write the W, the style change. I want the styles to enhance the basic attacks. Pirate style has to fit the pirate theme. EXPLOSIVES! Prayer style... some prayer to Nagakabouros? Enhanced passive range and damage?

E being only a dash the ult would have to be way too powerful. Let's add some phys damage to it. MORE EXPLOSIVES!

The ult is intended to feel like it could crush ships (RIP GP). I imagine it to pulsate to the beat of the rythm and look like the wrath of a whole ocean got cast uppon the ones unlucky enough to be impacted by it. At the same time it has to have some counterplay to it. Maybe an aftermath? Waves that circulate around it for some seconds? Completely overtuned, completely noisy, but it has some charme.

Yep, the Ult is overtuned af. I won't downtune it though. It has to be tested out in practice to get the numbers right.
