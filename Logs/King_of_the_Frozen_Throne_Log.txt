I want to keep the theme of a smith turned into a protector. He kinda has to be friends with Ornn and probably with the three Sisters (Avarosa, Serylda, Lissandra). A legend among the modern freljordans, but reality to all that remain from the age of the Iceborn. I picture him having a good relationship to Anivia too as their goals are one and the same. Volibear probably doesn't like him.

The kit is a mess. I will keep parts of the ult and passive as they are pretty good already. Now, what to do with him? We don't need another minionmancer - thank you very much. A melee mage? I'd love that! Meele skirmisher mage. He will need a high amount of mobility on one ability, a good dps ability for melee range and potent defense in one way or another.

Btw, yes the original idea was based on Arthas Menethil, or as most of you might know him: The Lich King

The passive will keep the phys and mag dmg thing. Let's add something related to the life-and-death theme he had going. Maybe minionmancing? I don't want to, but i have an idea how to make it less impactful than the minionmancing of other champions (I am looking at you Yorick.).

Looking at the skirmisher-formula Q needs to do a nice amount relyable damage while. Let's take Yasuo Q and mix some Kayn to it (that was a joke btw, you can apply this to most skirmishers in some way. Of course I completely thought of the ability myself. WHY DO I JUSTIFY MY ACTIONS THIS WAY). Let's add a little bit of frost theme -> ice -> slow and BOOOM we have an ability. Skirmishers are ez (report me for unsportsmanlike behaviour).

I want to add some of his blacksmith-background to the kit. I picture Teredo as the opposite of Ornn. Instead of having masterworks without magic his masterworks are of pure magic. Enchantments on any item that is NO MASTERWORK OF ORNN on his passive, a spell mirror with his hammer on his W. Enough smithing for now, I work out the details on the enchantments later.

Let's bring back Snowflake. It is clear that old Snowflake is just wanky af, so let's give him an overhaul and over all more purpose. You still have to summon him, and he will still be a seperate entity on the map. He is our mobility tool. His new name is a reference. Can you tell? ;)

Renaming the ult now. I literally smashed my face against my keyboard and tried to make any sense out of it -> Eizzane.
There is not much to say, it is a generic frost-dragon pet with cone damage. I balanced it as good as I can, playtests would show if I succeded but... well... 

Lets get to the enchantments. I don't want flat stats. I want passive effects and I want to have them to be runes. Around two options per general archetype.


Enchanter/Catcher/Sup:
	Something to increase your CC force.
	Something to increase your healing output.
	Utility for tank sups
	
Marksman/AS based champions:
	Something that gives you a double proc on one basic attack every X seconds
	Something that slows enemies
	
Mages:
	Bonus Ult or basic CDR
	Resonating effect on enemy kill
	
Assassins:
	A shield on first damage output
	Bleed effect

Fighter:
	survivability

Tank:
	% damage received shield


I guess I will roll with that. Let's think of the specifics now.

I am pretty ok with how the runes turned out. Maybe some have to be nerfed, but overall I think they would work quite nicely in the game.


LORE!
I want to keep some things:
	He is a blacksmith that forged a sword that grants imortality and imense power.
	He was good friends with the 3 iceborn sisters
	They wanted him to wield the sword
	His goal is to protect the Freljord

I guess this time I will think of something completely on the fly.

I feel like writing a scene with Teredo and Avarosa. Gonna do that too.
