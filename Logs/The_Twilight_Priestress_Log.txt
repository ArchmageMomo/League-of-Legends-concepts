I decided to rework this concept as it was quite broken and didn't fit into the universe. I wanted to keep the ability that stood out the most: her E.
I went back to the roots of the concept and placed her in Demacia. Problem: There is only ONE other mage there (Lux, Shyvana if you consider the world-runes-and-female-dragons-theory) and magic is weakened due to petricite. Solution: Some distance to the capital and the forest.
Next I took a look at the champions she might interact with. Vayne is the obvious problem, because A: magic and B: not-that-bright-and-comfy-looking-magic. Arch enemy done.

I converted her E to her P and adapted it to be more simple. As I liked the old P (which was way too OP) I noted that it could reappear at specific spots in her kit.

Next Problem: A name. Random character, R, what sounds Demacian-ish? Rosanna. Nice.

I took some power off her basic attacks to make her more vulnerable. If needed I can revert that later.

I took a look at the original Q and decided to stick with the idea of the delayed damage. I reduced the delay so there is less of an anoyance through the delay. Also I decided to give the delay some purpose by punishing heals. Another spot for the 20% AP, yay!

I was forced to take a break from writing. This made me think of something. What if Rosanna was practicing mage, but also the high-priestress of a "newborn god" (something like Nagakabouros, just much less experienced)? Need to think of actual lore later. Q, E and R should probbably hint at it in their theme, W should use Rosannas own power. Quite a challenge, as I can't just use a tentacle theme for a twilight themed champion. What does the god even want? What does it stand for?

BALANCE! Balance between light and darkness, balance between rich and poor, balance between... you get the idea. Nagakabouros wants you to keep moving, to have a goal. This god wants you to accept that there is no perfection and that everyone has both a noble and good self and a disgusting and evil self. Does that god like Nagakabouros tho? I don't really think so, but who am I to decide (the one writing this. It's kinda my job.)

FINALLY i started thinking about abilities again. W seems to turn her into a counterpart to lux. Unintended turn, but i like that they don't really have to oppose each other but have opposing use of magic. Also: NO ROSANNA CROWNGUARD. That would require things that won't work with the actual game lore.
The Idea is a silence area with damaging edges. Need to work out the specifics and make it a nice defensive tool.

I kinda felt like running against a wall over and over again at this point. No idea on the E whatsoever, but I am not willing to skip it. Let's revisit the idea of the god for a moment. What does it look like? How would its powers visualize in the real world/the game? Nagakabouros has her tentacle arms, but what would the god of balance/twilight use to interact with the world? Shadows. Let's work with shadows.

The idea is the following. An ability that starts flying slowly and speeds up when it turns invisible. It can be kinda wide and has to deal a good amount of damage. Idk yet if minions will get damaged by it as well, but where's the harm. Reminder: define a visual effect on hit. I chose to give it the name of the original E because it seems to fit great in the context of her god giving her a hand - or a strange fur thingy. I guess I picture her god as a furry mess now. Fluffy.

Good news: I have a name for the god now, Phudhogorsh (Pronaunced something like [Fud-ho-gorrsh]). I struggled too hard coming up with a pronaunciation of this name to scrap it. Plus I think it does what it is supposed to: looking way too complicated to ever speak it out aloud but realistic enough to count as a name you can actually say out aloud. I envy Riot for the smooth sounding Nagakabouros by now.

Ult seems to turn out a super-powered Illa E. It has the potential to increase your damage output by an absurd amount, but gives a huge amount of counterplay options as it is pretty hard to kill someone when they are full HP with a shadow alone. It is pretty hard to balance this, and even harder to balance this around the balance theme. I think i screwed up there, but my calcs tell me that this isn't actually too broken (i hope...).

Did I hit what i wanted to hit? I think so. Is this a champion I would like to play? Partially, yes. The ult would have to be tested by someone though.
