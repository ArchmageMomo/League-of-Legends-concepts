First thoughts: FULL REWORK, SCRAP IT!
Second thoughts: Another character with an artist background. Everyone can see his movement but the music or rythm he dances to only exists in his mind. Sounds a lot like Jhin, but not quite as dark.

Let's start with a name. I roll the dice for the region this time as the general idea is pretty generic. I considered the following regions in this order: noxus, zaun, demacia, piltover, shurima, bilgewater
I rolled a 6 on a D6, so Bilgewater it is. Time for a pirate-ish name. Speaking of pirates, how about making "dancing mage" a pirate? With two sabers and magic and stuff. Maybe one of MFs people? Wycombe? Name generators are great

I want to keep him a ranged champion with a dance/rythm focused theme. That said, the old passives were simply overtuned and dumb. Let's make it more simple. Constant basic attacking in a circle. No impact of AS. Once he targets an enemy it turns into a ranged swordbeam.

Rest of the kit is gonna be hard for me.
I want to have an ability that changes the dance style of Wycombe and I would either put it onto his W or his E. After some thinking I decided on Pirate and Prayer style dancing which will influence his other basic abilities.

Pirate Q will be a generic pistol shot. I think of syncing it with his dance pattern.
Prayer Q seems to end up as a generic water spell that deals damage in a circle. Circle range will depend on the time passed inbetween beats.

I just realized that Bilgewater characters have english-ish names. Great. Give me a second to think of a new name. Done. Barry "Wycombe" Sund. I don't have to change a thing.
Ok, the byname Wycombe is stupid in this context. Let's change it to Rythm as it seems to be the most fitting nickname for him. I am amazed by how blind I am at times.

That Q took me way too long. Need a break before working out the details on the remaining basic ability.
