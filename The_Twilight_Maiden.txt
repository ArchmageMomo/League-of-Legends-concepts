Downfall of an empire:

"Milady", the servant shouted from afar, "we are being attacked!"
"Calm down. There's nearly anyone knowing about our empire, and even less know how to enter it." She knew that she was fooling herself. This servant never lied to her.
"The rift we were researching got instable. Monsters are rushing the research facility!" She noticed the wound on his arm, but forced herself to ignore it.
"Will we be able to defend ourselves against them?"
"I don't think ..." She jumped back as her servant started to scream in pain. In the blink of an eye, the servant was gone and a dark purple creature stood in front of her. A creature of the void. Knowing she had no other chance she left the shadows of Zhaun. The twilight realm in the cities shadow collapsed under her command, erasing void creatures as well as her kind, the dim ones, from existence. She sighed as she realized her situation. Now she wasn't only banished from her world, the twilight, also almost everyone who followed her into her exile was dead, burried in the shadows of Zhaun.
"But you would never leave me, right?" Dozends of red eyes opened in her shadow. "Unfortunately I can't carry all of you around in the bright world. You have to seek shelter in the shadows of the natives around me." The twilight wolves wimpered. "I don't like it either, but it has to be this way. I may have to live among the bright ones for some while." Slowly the wolves jumped out of her shadow, just to enter Zhaun's. As the last one left, she turned to the cities gate. She wasn't a queen anymore. She wasn't even anything anymore, just an unknown girl in a pested city
