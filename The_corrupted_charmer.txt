Mirko, The corrupted charmer

B:
	100 Units
	
P: The One
	
	Every minion killed by Mirko or his slaves gets revived with (10-60)% HP uppon dath, switching allegiance and rewarding half their gold value. Minions revived get marked as his slaves. If this minion dies a second time, it dies for good and rewards Mirko with the second half of their gold value.
	
	If the map has no minions on it, Mirko gains 20% CDR instead.

Q: Sweet nothing (70 Mana ; 300 Units ; 25 sec)

	Mirko promotes an allied minion or Champion, marking it as his slave. 
	
	This empowers Minions with (40/50/60/70/80)% AD physical, (10/20/30/40/50)% AP magical damage on hit and (1/1.3/1.6/1.9/2.2) times armor and MR, as well as the greater of its and Mirkos AS.
	
	Champions get healed by (150/175/200/225/250) + 40% AP and loose their promotion after (3/4/5/6/7) seconds.
	
	Minions surrounding the promoted entity deal additional 20% of the promoted minions damage. This effect is not stackable.
	
	If the map has no minions on it, the cooldown gets reduced by 30%
	
W: Symbiosis (- ; 600 Units ; -)
	
	Mirko connects himself to a minion or allied champion by attaching a voidling, granting access to a secondary kit and marking them as his slave. Minions become controlable via champion inputs. Champions can still move by themselves, but Mirko can cast abilitys through them.
	
	If an enslaved champion gets damaged by more than (10/20/30/40/50)% of their max health the voidling and thus Mirko get detached from it. If the map has no minions on it, the health cap is doubled.
	
	Mirko is still voulnerable and can't move while Low resistance is active. If he gets killed, the entity he is attached to gets damaged by 20% current health magical damage.
	
	The effect of this ability is only visable on champions. If the target Mirko is attached to dies, Mirko gets stuned for 2 seconds. Mirko only gains half the gold and experience if he isn't within a (1000-2000) Units radius to the champion

E: Breach (90 Mana; 300 Units; 40 sec)

	Mirko creates a rift to the void. The rift stays open for (40/60/80/100/120) seconds and releases one voidling every 5 seconds. Voidlings deal (10/20/30/40/50) + 30% AP physical damage at 100% of Mirkos AS.
	
	The rift can be closed by enemy champions by channeling for 2 seconds. Up to 3 Rifts can be open at the same time. Breach disappears after (10-70) seconds if Mirko or the symbiot leaves a 2000 Units radius.

R: Agressive dominance (100 Mana ; 500 Units ; (240/200/160) sec)
	
	Mirko targets an enemy champion, causing it to struggle. While the champion struggles it can move freely, but can't attack or cast spells.
	The missing health of the enemy gets converted into dominance. Every second the enemy champion negates the greater of (55/45/35)% [AP + 1.3 * AD] and 15% dominance. If all dominance got negated, the spell ends.
	If the enemy champion falls below (5/10/15)% HP during the effect of this ability it dies and gets revived as a slave at Mirkos location. The revived champion has all stats reduced by (40/30/20)%, is controlable and uses the original champions basic abilities.
	
Symbiosis Q: Impale (60 Mana ; 700 Units ; 12 sec)
	The symbiot summons a void spike into the targeted direction. Enemy champions hit get damaged by (30/50/70/90/110) + 30% AD physical damage, rooted for 0.7 seconds and then pulled by 50% towards this champion.
	
Symbiosis W: Void Pheromones (20 Mana ; 500 Units ; 5 sec)
	The symbiot launches a bubble of an unknown liquid at the targeted location, dealing (40/60/80/100/120) + 50% AP magical damage to enemy champions and epic monsters and fearing minions for (1/1.5/2/2.5/3) seconds.
	
Symbiosis E: Void Passage (50 Mana ; 500 Units ; 15 sec)
	The symbiot prepares for (4/3.5/3/2.5/2) seconds to blink the unit he is attached to into the targeted direction. If attached to a champion, the champion can trigger the blink within a 4 second window. If attached to a minion the blink gets executed instantly

Symbiosis R: Strange attractor (100 Mana ; global ; (90/70/50) sec)
	(Unskilled/On CD)
		Exits the symbiosis, but leaves the symbiot behind for quick global reconnection.
		
	Every enemy gets sucked towards the symbiot by (300/350/400) Units per second  for (1/1.5/2) seconds, adjusting their MS relative to their walking direction. Destroys the symbiot.
